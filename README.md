Region7
=======
Region7 shows how to create GPS-based and iBeacon-based regions that may be monitored in the foreground, background, or even if the app is simply just installed.

There are hardcoded GPS Coordinates and iBeacon Parameters that can be adjusted inline with the source or "done the right way" for your specific need.

Requirements
============
*  iOS7 or Greater
*  Core Location Framework
